Requires redis, sqlite

To run:
$python makedb.py
$python stream.py 
$python app.py

Notes: 
-makedb.py only needs to run on the first run. 
-Might make sense to start the stream first to saturate the database
-tags.py are the search terms. Changing anything in here will dynamically
  change what is displayed
